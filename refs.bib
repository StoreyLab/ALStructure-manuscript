However, inferring population structure in large modern data sets imposes severe computational challenges. Here, we develop efficient algorithms for approximate inference of the model underlying the STRUCTURE program using a variational Bayesian framework. Variational methods pose the problem of computing relevant posterior distributions as an optimization problem, allowing us to build on recent advances in optimization theory to develop fast inference tools. In addition, we propose useful heuristic scores to identify the number of populations represented in a data set and a new hierarchical prior to detect weak population structure in the data. We test the variational algorithms on simulated data and illustrate using genotype data from the CEPH{\textendash}Human Genome Diversity Panel. The variational algorithms are almost two orders of magnitude faster than STRUCTURE and achieve accuracies comparable to those of ADMIXTURE. Furthermore, our results show that the heuristic scores for choosing model complexity provide a reasonable range of values for the number of populations represented in the data, with minimal bias toward detecting structure when it is very weak. Our algorithm, fastSTRUCTURE, is freely available online at http://pritchardlab.stanford.edu/structure.html.},

	abstract = {FST and kinship are key parameters often estimated in modern population genetics studies. Kinship matrices have also become a fundamental quantity used in genome-wide association studies and heritability estimation. The most frequently used estimators of FST and kinship are method of moments estimators whose accuracies depend strongly on the existence of simple underlying forms of structure, such as the island model of non-overlapping, independently evolving subpopulations. However, modern data sets have revealed that these simple models of structure do not likely hold in many populations, including humans. In this work, we provide new results on the behavior of these estimators in the presence of arbitrarily complex population structures. After establishing a framework for assessing bias and consistency of genome-wide estimators, we calculate the accuracy of FST and kinship estimators under arbitrary population structures, characterizing biases and estimation challenges unobserved under their originally assumed models of structure. We illustrate our results using simulated genotypes from an admixture model, constructing a one-dimensional geographic scenario that departs nontrivially from the island model. Using 1000 Genomes Project data, we verify that population-level pairwise FST estimates underestimate differentiation measured by an individual-level pairwise FST estimator introduced here. We show that the calculated biases are due to unknown quantities that cannot be estimated under the established frameworks, highlighting the need for innovative estimation approaches in complex populations. We provide initial results that point towards a future estimation framework for generalized FST and kinship.},

Recently, algorithms have been introduced that provide provable bounds, but these algorithms are not practical because they are inefficient and not robust to violations of model assumptions. In this paper we present an algorithm for learning topic models that is both provable and practical. The algorithm produces results comparable to the best MCMC implementations while running orders of magnitude faster.}

In admixture-based models each individual is assumed to have inherited some proportion of its ancestry from one of several distinct populations. PCA projects the individuals into a low-dimensional subspace. On the face of it, these methods seem to have little in common. Here we show how in fact both of these methods can be viewed within a single unifying framework. This viewpoint should help practitioners to better interpret and contrast the results from these methods in real data applications. It also provides a springboard to the development of novel approaches to this problem. We introduce one such novel approach, based on sparse factor analysis, which has elements in common with both admixture-based models and PCA. As we illustrate here, in some settings sparse factor analysis may provide more interpretable results than either admixture-based models or PCA.},

Our analysis reveals that there are four dominant ancestries in mainland populations of India, contrary to two ancestries inferred earlier. We also show that (i) there is a distinctive ancestry of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands populations that is likely ancestral also to Oceanic populations, and (ii) the extant mainland populations admixed widely irrespective of ancestry, which was rapidly replaced by endogamy, particularly among Indo-European{\textendash}speaking upper castes, about 70 generations ago. This coincides with the historical period of formulation and adoption of some relevant sociocultural norms.India, occupying the center stage of Paleolithic and Neolithic migrations, has been underrepresented in genome-wide studies of variation. Systematic analysis of genome-wide data, using multiple robust statistical methods, on (i) 367 unrelated individuals drawn from 18 mainland and 2 island (Andaman and Nicobar Islands) populations selected to represent geographic, linguistic, and ethnic diversities, and (ii) individuals from populations represented in the Human Genome Diversity Panel (HGDP), reveal four major ancestries in mainland India. This contrasts with an earlier inference of two ancestries based on limited population sampling. A distinct ancestry of the populations of Andaman archipelago was identified and found to be coancestral to Oceanic populations. Analysis of ancestral haplotype blocks revealed that extant mainland populations (i) admixed widely irrespective of ancestry, although admixtures between populations was not always symmetric, and (ii) this practice was rapidly replaced by endogamy about 70 generations ago, among upper castes and Indo-European speakers predominantly. This estimated time coincides with the historical period of formulation and adoption of sociocultural norms restricting intermarriage in large social strata. A similar replacement observed among tribal populations was temporally less uniform.},

abstract="We review algorithms developed for nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) and nonnegative tensor factorization (NTF) from a unified view based on the block coordinate descent (BCD) framework. NMF and NTF are low-rank approximation methods for matrices and tensors in which the low-rank factors are constrained to have only nonnegative elements. The nonnegativity constraints have been shown to enable natural interpretations and allow better solutions in numerous applications including text analysis, computer vision, and bioinformatics. However, the computation of NMF and NTF remains challenging and expensive due the constraints. Numerous algorithmic approaches have been proposed to efficiently compute NMF and NTF. The BCD framework in constrained non-linear optimization readily explains the theoretical convergence properties of several efficient NMF and NTF algorithms, which are consistent with experimental observations reported in literature. In addition, we discuss algorithms that do not fit in the BCD framework contrasting them from those based on the BCD framework. With insights acquired from the unified perspective, we also propose efficient algorithms for updating NMF when there is a small change in the reduced dimension or in the data. The effectiveness of the proposed updating algorithms are validated experimentally with synthetic and real-world data sets.",

    abstract = {Author Summary The first step in almost every genetic analysis is to establish how sample members are related to each other. High relatedness between individuals can arise if they share a small number of recent ancestors, e.g. if they are distant cousins or a larger number of more distant ones, e.g. if their ancestors come from the same region. The most popular methods for investigating these relationships analyse successive markers independently, simply adding the information they provide. This works well for studies involving hundreds of markers scattered around the genome but is less appropriate now that entire genomes can be sequenced. We describe a “chromosome painting” approach to characterising shared ancestry that takes into account the fact that DNA is transmitted from generation to generation as a linear molecule in chromosomes. We show that the approach increases resolution relative to previous techniques, allowing differences in ancestry profiles among individuals to be resolved at the finest scales yet. We provide mathematical, statistical, and graphical machinery to exploit this new information and to characterize relationships at continental, regional, local, and family scales.},
