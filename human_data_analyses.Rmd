## R Markdown

In this document, we detail the procedures used to analyze the human datasets studied in _A likelihood-free estimator of population structure bridging admixture models and principal components analysis_ (<https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2019/03/27/240812.full.pdf>) 

## Data acquisition

The cleaned datasets used in the 


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
