## R Markdown

In this document, we detail the procedures used to analyze the human datasets studied in Cabreros and Storey, 2018 (<https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2019/03/27/240812.full.pdf>).

## Data acquisition

There are four human datasets analyzed in this work: 

1. TGP (1000 Genomes Project) [@TGP]
2. HGDP (Human Genome Diversity Project) [@HGDP]
3. HO (Human Origins) [@HO]
4. IND (India) [@basu]

The TGP, HGDP, and HO datasets are publically available, while the 


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
